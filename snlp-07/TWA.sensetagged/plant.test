Until the mid- and late 1970s, there were simply no rules whereby groupings of parents could obtain a state-financed, multi-denominational school, as the only channels of communication in these matters were those between the Department of Education and the relevant diocesan department or other church board. For example, a new housing estate would be built, the diocese would be informed of the development at the planning stage, and the diocesan office would put in for a school, or an extension for an existing school. The arrangement had been unchanged since the early years of the state and had become entirely natural. Similarly for the protestant community: the school  <head>plant</head>  is owned by the church, or appropriate church body.

THE incineration of PCBs requires a furnace which will hold the material at 1,100C for at least two seconds, in the presence of plenty of oxygen. Companies wishing to enter the waste disposal business at this level must demonstrate to the local Waste Disposal Authority (usually a county council, but in some cities and in Wales a more local authority) that they can meet various criteria, although the authority may be over-ruled on appeal to the Secretary of State for the Environment. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution is now the custodian of national standards on emissions from such plants, of which Britain currently has three. Rechem can take solid and liquid wastes contaminated with PCBs at its  <head>plant</head>  at Pontypool (30,000 tonnes a year), and liquid wastes (20,000 tonnes a year) at its plant at Fawley, near Southampton. Cleanaway can take liquid PCBs at its Ellesmere Port establishment, where it is building another plant which will take capacity there to 48,000 tonnes annually. Ocean Environmental Management has applied for a 30,000-tonne plant at Seal Sands, Teesside, and is appealing against the local authority's refusal to allow it. Leigh Environmental wants to build an incinerator plant near Doncaster, but also faces local authority opposition, and International Technology Corporation has submitted a joint application with Northumbrian Water for incinerators at Teesside and Tyneside for the incineration of sewage sludge and organic wastes, with a capacity of 43,000 tonnes each.

The Dutch government is so concerned that at next week's 103-nation conference in Lausanne of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) it will call for a total ban on trade in the plants.

There are more than 40 nuclear reactors and 22,000km of gas pipeline passing through built-up areas. The Siberian pipeline disaster, Chernobyl and Bhopal illustrate the potential risks. But the continuous scrutiny demanded and enforced by regulation of the high-risk cases and (for nuclear reactors) the designs of these installations are considerable forces on the side of safety. One day there will be a serious industrial accident; there are occasional near misses and worse; but it usually takes a good measure of folly, inattention and misfortune to overwhelm good  <head>plant</head>  and a safe system. Relatively few members of the public have been killed in Britain by industrial accidents in recent years. People expect risks they did not ask for and cannot control to be much lower -by 10 or 100 times  than those which they run willingly. People may smoke, drive at 80 miles an hour through fog on a motorway, go in for hang-gliding or rock climbing at the weekends. Yet they see nothing inconsistent with objecting to a well-engineered nuclear waste disposal plant which is clearly necessary to dispose safely of irradiated material already created; or to properly regulated high-combustion chemical waste disposal plants that are the only alternative (unless we get rid of the chemical industry) to toxic wastes being dumped surreptitiously in some field or on some beach.

Michael Harrison, our Industrial Editor, contrasts its performance with that of its foreign counterparts By MICHAEL HARRISON, Industrial Editor FORD'S ageing and ramshackle Dagenham site in Essex, once the jewel in the company's overseas operations, enters the 1990s with its very survival uncertain. The  <head>plant</head>  now dubiously boasts the poorest levels of productivity, quality and working conditions of any Ford factory in Europe. Unless it can effect a remarkable recovery, the factory may well disappear back into the bleak and sodden marshes of Essex from which it emerged nearly 60 years ago. The evidence of Dagenham's predicament can be gauged from internal company documents which illustrate graphically the task confronting Ford and its workforce. These show that it takes Dagenham nearly twice as long to produce a Sierra car as it does Ford's Genk plant in Belgium. The picture is similar when Fiesta production is compared at Dagenham and Valencia. The British plant takes 53 hours to turn out each car, the Spanish factory 30 hours. Product quality at the Essex factory is also inferior, measured against any index, whether it be ratings out of 10, defects per vehicle or warranty costs on each car leaving the factory gate. The Dagenham workforce would argue that there are good reasons why the ageing plant cannot match the performance of its modern Continental rivals. However, the documents also show that Dagenham's car body and assembly operations are failing to meet even its own internal targets. In 1988 the plant was scheduled to produce 992 cars a day.

Diagonally opposite the stove is the icon corner, although for a Belorussian peasant the most sacred spot is the stove column, where the souls of predecessors reside. Together with the first harvest sheaf hanging beside the icon  for its protective magic, these are reminders that our peasant lives in several cultural times simultaneously, one of them embedded deep in the pagan past, another in the religious present, a third focused on the trip she is about to take to the town of Roslavl'. And away and above her imagination lie the remote worlds of elegant Petrograd, and of Moscow, the city of the Communist future as well as of her inherited religious past. After making first animal feed ( korm ) and only later cabbage soup ( shchi ) for the family, she may finally turn to the work that occupies the womenfolk from November until Lent  spinning flax from that blue-flowered, frail-leaved  <head>plant</head>  plucked by the root in handfuls in the August of 1921.

Certainly, such peace as prevailed owed an immense amount to Jones's personal stature in the movement, as one of the old-style union leaders who had, nevertheless, taken an outward-looking and creative role in trying to relate union demands to a wider pattern of economic stability and also, incidentally, the wellbeing of a Labour government. Jack Jones was an interesting, transitional figure. He was an old leftist who had fought in Spain in the International Brigade. He had grown up in a quasi-syndicalist tradition in the Liverpool docks, and his influence in the sixties had been thrown behind the growth of the shop-stewards movement and local  <head>plant</head>  bargaining on a devolved basis very much on the lines of the 1968 Donovan Report.

However complex  the outward manifestations of the religious life may be, at bottom it is one and simple. It responds everywhere to one and the same need, and is everywhere derived from one and the same mental state. In all its forms, its object is to raise man above himself and to make him lead a life superior to that which he would lead, if he followed only his own individual whims: beliefs express this life in representations; rites organize it and regulate its working. This passage sheds much light on the method of Mr. Eliot's Sunday Morning Service where the self-mutilation of enervate Origen is placed in the same lineage as the sexual origin of the Word, and where the initial sapient sutlers of the Lord who Drift across the window-panes is a passage with an ambiguous, or better ambivalent, reference, since it holds together in one term both the sable presbyters who bring offerings to church and the bees who bring pollen from one part of the  <head>plant</head>  to another and so perform the Blest office of the epicene.

The Electricians Union was  prepared to follow the AUEW and, already faced with the breakaway Democratic Miners' Union in Nottingham, the TUC was forced to find a face-saving formula to avert a possible split.

After he pulled out of the Ryman operation, however, he left manufacturing for good. I was quite sorry to do so because I liked the manufacturing process very much indeed, but I don't believe you can be both a manufacturer and a retailer.

When I became chairman of Hepworths, it had its own clothing  <head>plant</head>  and it either produced too much or not enough of the right quality at the right price at the right time. There's always an argument between your own manufacturing company and the retailing side. Another problem is that if you're trying to deal with other manufacturers in the way that we do, where we have this extremely close relationship and they are very reliant on our forward forecasts of volume, they feel if you have  your own manufacturing plant that you would always give preference to it in bad times and the other suppliers would be the people to suffer if sales declined.

Such a management style was by no means typical of Nigeria alone. Direct theft from the parastatal system was common in Tanzania by the 1980s. Thus in 1988 the Tanzanian Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee reported that about 5 million had been taken in 1987 in the form of outright theft from parastatal companies. If there is a prevailing thread in the history of these state-owned enterprises it is the constant under-assessment of risk  of the lack of imported materials to supply a manufacturing process, of failure in the supply of inputs ranging from petrol to fertilizer, of farming communities not producing the cash crops to keep a processing  <head>plant</head>  in operation, and of failing to find competent management for complex operations.

Before describing the opportunities and shortcomings of such structures for conversion to domestic use, it is necessary to say something about the process of grinding grain to produce flour, because the anatomy of these buildings was dictated by this process. Corn-milling is one of the oldest and most necessary human occupations. The main good grains on which we depend for an essential part of our daily diet come from plants belonging to the family of grasses and cannot be readily digested until the tough outer shells are broken up and, sometimes, removed. A grain of wheat, for example, consists essentially of three parts: the bran, made up of several outer coverings, the germ (the embryo of the new  <head>plant</head> ) and the endosperm, the starchy centre which is made into flour.

NO LONGER can the Government disguise the crisis surrounding electricity privatisation. Ministers have already had to pull Britain's fleet of Magnox reactors out of the float and delay the sell-off date by up to six months.

After months of turning deaf ears to warnings by the City and industry, the Department of Energy has at last conceded that nuclear  <head>plant</head>  cannot be included in the share float without state support. This leaves the Energy Secretary, Mr John Wakeham, with two options: he can either agree to underwrite any cost escalations in nuclear handling costs after privatisation, or he can swallow his pride, and pull all nuclear plant out of the impending sale.

A report to be published later this month is understood to detail a series of shortcomings in the rushed sale of the motor company to the group which was approved by Lord Young, the former Trade Secretary.

Rover believes in catching them young as Judith Jackson discovered in Swindon The body shop Motoring. THE Rover  <head>plant</head>  at Swindon is not a pretty place. But behind this typical example of dreary industrial architecture, much is going on which should encourage us. For Rover is busy introducing young people to engineering. Engineering is not a glamorous pursuit, nor does Swindon produce the final glossy motor car which might lure potential workers. But the pressings which come out of the plant for Cowley and Longbridge are essential. In an area where unemployment struggles to reach 3 per cent, school leavers are spoiled for choice, so it is in a spirit of enlightened self-interest that the Swindon managers have embarked on programmes designed to tempt young people into engineering. Ray Fletcher, the personnel manager at Rover's Swindon plant and Graham Spaull, the training manager, are concerned that to many youngsters engineering means long hours, tedious jobs and dirty hands. Part of this myth is perpetrated by educationists who have been no nearer a press shop than a picture in a newspaper; parents also see their offspring in cleaner, more respectable jobs. So the success of 20 youngsters on a two-week work experience programme in the Swindon plant on Monday is crucial to the future of engineering in general and the motor industry in particular.

Declaring that the Department of Energy's about-turn will result in merely a temporary interruption to atomic development, chairman Mr Christopher Harding admitted that the nuclear industry's image has been damaged by fears about nuclear waste. Despite the wealth of evidence that nuclear power can never under-price fossil fuel-generated electricity, BNFL is looking at ways of competing for supply in the open market.

The new  <head>plant</head>  would have capacity of between 600 and 2,400 megawatts of power. The company is also planning to expand the life of the existing Magnox reactors by another 10 years. Development costs could be reduced by expanding these existing nuclear sites which are currently used primarily to produce fuel for military purposes. Construction could be caried out as a joint venture with the new state-owned company set up to operate all existing nuclear plant.

This revealed that the EC would only challenge BAe to honour Rover's plans if there were significant variations, and even then would limit the amount to be reimbursed by the company. Details of the tax deal emerge in a confidential letter from Peat Marwick Mitchell, BAe's tax advisers, showing that the company could offset Rover's losses for tax purposes for three years without fear of a challenge from tax officials. The letter said the Board of Inland Revenue would need to meet before any action could be taken, and BAe and Rover were guaranteed a hearing before action was taken.

But in order to fully answer the question what is aromatherapy?, we need to take a closer look at these amazing aromatic oils. ABOUT ESSENTIAL OILS Essential oils, or essences as they are often called, are the odoriferous, volatile (they readily evaporate) liquid components of aromatic plants. They accumulate in specialised cells or in specific parts of the  <head>plant</head> . They may be found in the petals (rose), the leaves (eucalyptus), the wood (sandalwood), the fruit (lemon), the seeds (caraway), roots (sassafras), rhizomes (ginger), resin (pine), gums (frankincense), and sometimes in more than one part of the plant. Lavender, for instance, yields an essential oil from the flowers and leaves. The orange tree is particularly interesting for it produces three different-smelling essences with differing therapeutic properties: neroli (blossom), petit-grain (leaves) and orange (rind). A plant produces essential oils for its own survival: to influence growth and production; to attract pollinating insects; to repel predators; and to protect itself from disease.

That Eden should have allowed the Cabinet a full and lengthy debate on 3 November 1955 could be construed as skilled management, and his referral of the issue for further thought to a Cabinet committee might be seen as prudent policy. His pattern of personal leadership, as revealed by the Cabinet committees he chose to chair himself, reinforces the standard interpretation of him as a man more at ease with overseas than with domestic policy. He followed Churchill's practice and allowed Butler, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to chair the Economic Policy Committee. Eden, naturally, took Churchill's place at the head of the Defence Committee, and the list of ad hoc committees he chaired reflects both his appetites and the intrinsic importance of their subject matter: GEN 502 on the supply of military aircraft; GEN 503 on security in Cyprus; GEN 506 on preparations for the meeting of foreign  ministers of France, the UK, USSR and USA in Geneva in October 1955; and GEN 511 on a third Indian steel  <head>plant</head> .

Last month ICI announced that its third Klea ICI 134a (HFC134a) plant will be built at Mihara, near Hiroshima in Japan. The plant will be built in partnership with Teijin, a long-standing joint venture partner of ICI in agrochemicals. The JV aims to link ICI's process technology and application expertise at its Japan Technical Centre at Tsukuba Science City with Teijin's production experience. The plant will have an initial capacity of 5000 tonnes pa when it comes on stream in 1993, supplying the Asia Pacific refrigeration markets.

For more than 50 years I have nurtured what might be called an insatiable interest in China and the arts, crafts, and accomplishments of the Chinese people, the oldest extant civilization on earth. Whether this burning interest came from a transmigration from a previous existence I do not know, but it may have been sparked off by a small and relatively insignificant incident which occurred in the spring of 1929. From time to time, and I think mainly to keep in touch, Aunt Janie would ring me to ask if I could come to the house to help with a small task, such as fixing the cellar door, hammering in a stray loose plank over the cistern and so on  although she must have known as well as I did how useless I was at such household chores.

A total of 22 552 workers were followed up on an average of 18.6 years. Overall mortality was 23% lower than the national average for all causes of death and 18% lower for cancer. For a small group of workers, however, who had experienced above average external exposure and had also been monitored for internal contamination by radionuclides, the mortality from cancer of the prostate gland and the lung was raised (Beral et al, 1988). In workforces in the USA, excess mortality from prostatic cancer has also been reported in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and in a weapon  <head>plant</head>  but, Beral et al continue, recent data from the Japanese atomic bomb survivors show no association between a single acute exposure to high levels of radiation and mortality from prostatic cancer. The authors indicate therefore that excesses of prostatic cancer in industrial workforces are unlikely to be due to external radiation. Cancers in other specific body sites were also monitored and compared with surveys from other countries but more research requires to be done. Certainly following the far-flung effects of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in 1986, the health hazards associated with nuclear products have been highlighted, not only for employees and people in the immediate environs of a nuclear plant but also for people and terrain far distant from the scene of the nuclear leak.

Few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of Kamchatcka and caused no known casualties.

Although it is conceded that a decline occurred in a few trades, reformers are said to  have been confused by terminology and to have failed to distinguish between deskilling of individual jobs and industrial changes which led to the number of jobs in certain industries or occupations declining either relatively or absolutely, but not to the nature of the job themselves changing. Other writers have concluded differently, especially with reference to engineering, building, shipbuilding, and printing. Whatever the disagreements, it seems reasonable to say that the period circa  18901914 witnessed an unprecedented advance of machine technique and of mechanisation generally and automatism in particular.

Labour MPs and some key Conservative figures, such as Michael Heseltine and Leon Brittan, argued that a removal of the automatic grant would worsen regional imbalances (Duffy, 1988). Obviously, companies prefer automatic grant, but that is not a justification from the government's point of view (Begg and McDowell, 1987). This loss of automatic grant might prove particularly important when regions attempt to attract major international inward investments. The Nissan car  <head>plant</head>  near Sunderland is a notable example of this.

The apparently extreme view expressed by Masterman (1987) may perhaps be the public perception of local-authority services as a whole, but equally many people working in schools would also subscribe to this view when discussing the local education authority's administration of the education service. Any superficial investigation into the role of the education officer will dispel the view expressed by Masterman once some appreciation and understanding is gained of the day-to-day duties that are performed both in terms of strategic planning and institutional management. A view from county offices is equally, and often, a mirror image of the incoming vibrations.

In the Dinantian rocks which appear to form a major part of the leading Variscan thrust slice, the source potential of the limestones and dolomites (which represent shallow water facies) is assumed on the whole to be relatively low. The underlying Lower Limestone Shale is also interpreted as a shallow water sequence, but some beds are believed to have been laid down in poorly aerated conditions (George 1958) and may therefore contain source material. Further south, deeper water conditions, and hence the possibility of preservation of organic matter, persisted from the Devonian into the Early Carboniferous. During the Late Carboniferous the proliferation of  <head>plant</head>  growth on land not only provided coal seams but contributed abundant particulate and dissolved organic matter to the pro-delta and deeper marine areas.

The students spend a given amount of time per week for a period of months, with the guidance of an assigned individual in the company and with the support of the technical staff of the school or college. At the end of the process students present their solution to a panel of mixed experts and lay people, and answer questions about the engineering issues as well as matters to do with team-building, leadership, decision-making and planning. The main objective is to find a solution agreeable to the company in terms of its feasibility and cost.

Thus grassland (especially wet) is an important habitat for many specialised bird species, and its loss has reduced and restricted their populations. Other habitat losses have resulted from farm mechanisation which, requiring larger and more conveniently-shaped fields, has resulted in much hedge and scrub clearance. The more satisfactory economic position of farming allied with Government policies have also encouraged these losses. There have been dramatic declines of a few bird species as a result of using some chemicals, and perhaps more subtle and long-term changes as a result of the simplification of the  <head>plant</head>  community of farmland arising from cropping changes and the widespread use of increasingly sophisticated herbicides.

The accident happened when workers at the ICMESA plant neglected to add water to stop a reaction producing trichlorophenol (TCP) as they went off shift early one Saturday morning. The reactor's contents spontaneously over-heated, expanded, blew valves on vents and emptied the contents of the cauldron into the air above the plant.

On 1 October the Italians proposed to the convention's scientific committee that the reactor pot, which was at the heart of the explosion, should be dumped, 700 km off the Spanish coast in the area used annually by Britain for dumping nuclear waste. But rumour is rife that the reactor pot has already been buried.

One activity that has already been set up is the international Intor workshop, in which groups from the US, Europe, japan and the USSR have met to establish a common set of objectives and an optimum design for demonstrating the technology needed for a fusion reactor based on the tokamak system. The International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations organises the Intor workshops (Intor stands for International Tokamak Reactor) although most of the work is actually carried out by groups working in their various home laboratories. The leading groups meet in Vienna periodically to bring the work together. The Intor workshop has already produced a first broad proposal a definition of the envisaged  <head>plant</head>  and its objectives. Intor is presently conceived as a 600 MW (thermal) reactor that would run for 10 years, researching and, we hope, demonstrating the practicability of repeated long pulses burning thermonuclear fuel in a tokamak. Intor could also test the life of components in the flux of neutrons  at an energy of 14 MeV  produced by reactions between deuterium and tritium. Such a device would become radioactive because of those neutrons and Intor would also have to demonstrate the practicability of maintenance by remote control. Intor would not produce electricity, that would come later in the so-called demonstration plant.

BY NOW Sir Frank Layfield QC will be well aware of the task that is before him. It is nearly a year and a half since David Howell, the then Secretary of State for Energy, announced that Sir Frank would be the inspector at the public inquiry into the plans of the Central Electricity Generating Board to build a pressurised-water reactor (PWR) at Sizewell in Suffolk, and there has been a veritable deluge of documentation from all sides in the past 18 months, giving Sir Frank more than enough preliminary reading. There are various theories as to how long the inquiry will last, ranging from four months to nine months, or even longer. The shorter estimate comes from one or two optimists within the electricity supply industry who believe that the opponents to the plans to build the Sizewell PWR will prove less persistent than they were at the inquiry into the plans to expand the nuclear fuel  <head>plant</head>  at Windscale in Cumbria.

This time the issue is the safety of the clean-up of the plant. During the past fortnight engineers working on the site have charged, in affidavits, that the efforts to remove damaged uranium fuel from the reactor are sloppy. The present mentality on the island emphasises short cuts, expedience and disdain for professional standard, said Edwin Gishel, engineering director for site operations in an affidavit sent last week to his employer, the General Public Utilities Corporation. And Richard Parks, an engineer with the Bechtel Corporation, which built the plant and is the prime contractor for the clean-up, claimed that the operation is disorganised and at times irresponsible.

Storage leaves open the option of reprocessing later, he says, if the value of the uranium and plutonium that could be reclaimed in the process, made it worthwhile. Deacon's plan would involve every nuclear power station in Britain becoming a mini-Windscale, storing many years worth of spent fuel on-site. But the CEGB prefers the idea of a central store. The board says it needs such a store in any case in the 1990s because there may be a shortage of reprocessing capacity at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield  <head>plant</head>  ( New Scientist , 3 February, p 289). But the new admission that Britain is considering (forgetting) about further reprocessing plant opens up the possibility that the temporary store may become a long-term dumping ground for the industry's most dangerous waste.

We know from Cato the Censor (234149 BC), the author of De agri cultura , that the various methods of planting, grafting, training and pruning of the vine, which the Romans would have introduced into Champagne, had been in common use throughout the warmer parts of the empire for at least two hundred years.

This was achieved through photosynthesis: plants were    able, by converting sunlight into energy, to live solely on sunshine, air and water, combined with other simple elements gleaned from the soil. They produce oxygen as a waste product, a normally lethal poison to the  <head>plant</head>  cell.

Although Stevie and I had known each other for a while we had never been romantically involved. Then somehow we did get romantically linked up and some people, right near the end of the situation with that band, singled us out as potentially more interesting than the band, which I suppose was a cruel situation really. By this time I had already been fooling around with sound on sound recording, and then in 1971 some aunt that I never even knew left a small house to me and my two brothers. The house was sold off and I ended up inheriting 12,000 dollars, so I went straight out and bought an AG 440 Ampex professional four track machine and took it up to my father's coffee  <head>plant</head> , and every night when he left I would drive up and work on Stevie's and my songs.

History is the study of the past using documents and inscriptions as evidence, and historians have recorded and interpreted events from the earliest days of writing up to the present day. Archaeology, on the other hand, is the study of the past using objects and other excavated evidence as the main source of data.

Almost anything can be used to shed light on the past: the foundations of buildings can show what sort of houses people lived in; the remains of tools show how they worked; animal bones and  <head>plant</head>  remains show what they ate; and pollen, snail shells and the remains of trees and plants can indicate the type of climate and vegetation at the time.

So generous is this bequest by birds to their young that a chick needs no additional food from which to build the flesh and bones and feathers of its infant body, and it still has enough energy left over to break its way out of the shell.

The most diligent student of the region's past will find it extremely difficult to fix upon any period in earlier times in which the condition of the people can be seen as more attractive than the point reached by the early 1960s. The actual industrial structure of the mid-1960s, by which time the massive Robens-led reduction in mining employment was already underway, is given in Table 3.1 and compared with the situation in 1976 and 1986. The changes over the period 196676 are interesting. The transition from the post-war boom in traditional industries to a modernized branch  <head>plant</head>  structure occurred after the Hailsham Plan of 1963 and changed the nature of the origins of the region's economic problems from overspecialization by industrial sector (i.e. over-reliance on old basic industries particularly affected by changing market demands and the new international division of labour) into overspecialization by corporate function (i.e. under-representation of control and research and development functions).
