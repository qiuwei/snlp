In 1984, there were 41; two years ago, 31. Last year 23 arrived. Only 13 reached Iran. The Siberian  <head>crane</head>  stands four and a half feet tall, its brilliant white plumage offset by a blood-red beak, face and legs. Jet-black wing quills are visible in flight. Like most birdwatchers, I have only seen them in pictures -invariably in supremely elegant poses, their long, thin beaks delicately probing the water for weeds. Unlike most birdwatchers, I am lucky enough to live less than four hours' drive from their regular winter home  a wildfowl marsh constructed by one of the Maharajahs of Bharatpur. I was there recently, talking to Dr Lalitha Vijayam about her research on the Siberian crane's problems and about my chances of seeing one before the Ob river race becomes extinct.

Waterloo Bridge, so named because it was built in the year of the battle (1815), is one of the oldest of the iron bridges of considerable size. It was built by Telford ( q.v. ) to span the River Conwy at the southern edge of the town, as part of his work on the Holyhead road, and is an extravagant example of ironwork, cast by William Hazledine at his Plas Kynaston foundries, where the ironwork was also cast for the aqueduct at Pont Cysyllte ( q.v. ).

No official go-ahead from the national safety authorities has yet been given. But French nuclear experts are convinced that the reference accident (a core melt-down in which the molten fuel reacts with the sodium coolant) is so improbable that the secondary containment dome can be done away with. In light-water reactors (including PWRs) the concrete shell of the reactor building needs to withstand a pressure of five bars, whereas a fast breeder has to cope with a mere 40 millibars, according to an Electricite de France engineer.

And Richard Parks, an engineer with the Bechtel Corporation, which built the plant and is the prime contractor for the clean-up, claimed that the operation is disorganised and at times irresponsible. There is a serious lack of coordination between Bechtel, GPU, the subcontractor and the federal agencies involved here. Bechtel has since suspended Parks. One point of contention is GPU's plan to use a  <head>crane</head>  inside the reactor building to lift the 170 tonne steel top off the reactor and then lift out the 40 000 uranium fuel elements in the  stricken  reactor. Parks and Gischel say that the crane may have been damaged in the original accident. GPU and Bechtel counter that tests have shown no sign of damage to the crane, and that all procedures were safe.

It is for this reason whales and hippopotami actually increase their mass to prevent floating. There is also evidence, as we have mentioned before and shall see in the next chapter, of the extensive use of air sacs in sauropods as cooling devices and for reducing mass. Many sauropods, in spite of their ever-growing height spurred on by the need to reach the foliage of trees growing ever higher, had hollowed out, weight-saving  vertebrae and a pelvic girdle described by one writer as being like a suspension bridge, with the massive erect hind legs acting as the down-pillar, and the long torso and rigid tail acting as the cross-span. Indeed, the six-metre long sauropod neck has been likened to a living  <head>crane</head>  for lifting the head to feed, with up to fifteen vertebrae possessing unique extra articulations in the neck to combine strength with agility.

Both The Daleks and The Sensorites featured very elaborate backdrops, all of which Cusick had first to draft out as large, highly detailed colour illustrations long before the day when the Scenic Artist would come in to paint them up. Neither could these illustrations just be rough approximations of the finished articles. The perspectives, the horizon points, the viewing angles all had to be worked out beforehand so that camera shots would enable the backdrops to appear as natural continuations of the sets, instead of suddenly sloping up or downhill. If a  <head>crane</head>  camera was to be used, for instance, it would be no use designing a backdrop with a vanishing point relevant to one of its pedestal mounted brethren.

One advantage is that if for any reason the storage system becomes unused the building may be used for other purposes. The racking is constructed on a back-to-back principle up to 20 metres high with intervening gangways as little as 1.5 metres wide. Typical rack lengths are between 100 and 200 metres and number of aisles can vary from as little as 2 to as many as 30. In some systems one  <head>crane</head>  serves more than one aisle and in this case is moved from aisle to aisle by an automatic transfer system. Pallets may be placed away either under manual or automatic control according to the control system chosen. In the case of manual systems one person per crane is usually all that is required to operate that part of the system with in-feed fork- lift trucks being restricted to an access area at the front of the warehouse. Automatic systems usually have an in-feed/out-feed conveyor and sufficient forklift trucks to feed the system  again in each case they are not operating within the crane and storage area. A firm principle with this kind of automatic system is restriction of access to anyone other than maintenance and inventory control personnel, in which case a strict control is kept upon crane operation.

Overall these species are darker, smaller and hairier than temperate counterparts. Darkness and hairiness, especially noticeable in butterflies of the genera Boloria  and Colias , are taken to be adaptations for absorbing and retaining heat during basking. Smallness facilitates rapid warming to working temperatures, though it may also be a symptom of food sparsity; compactness, including relative shortness of limbs and wings, helps to conserve heat and moisture. Wings are short or absent in several arctic species of stone flies,  <head>crane</head>  flies, midges and moths; females are especially likely to have reduced wings and  to avoid flying.

Entirely encased in a latex bodysuit she becomes anonymous, even androgynous. Hanging limp as a corpse, or straining to hold complex, delicately balanced poses, the elation of her soaring figure is juxtaposed with the very real pain and physical distress incurred.

Because China is a vast country with many dialects, certain kung fu schools practise styles that are the same but have different names. The praying mantis style for instance, is known in Cantonese as tong long or won long. The kung fu styles developed at the Shaolin temple were based on the movements of animals. There were five in all, the tiger,  <head>crane</head> , leopard, snake and dragon. In later years one or two animals were adopted, along with their natural movements, to form the nucleus for a complete system of kung fu. The southern Chinese style of hung gar (Hung family) was adapted from the Shaolin tiger system, which also incorporates movements from the white crane style.

The Liebherr LTM 1090 crane replaces a similar capacity vehicle which had been in service at the terminal since May 1982. The all-terrain model offers steering on all its ten wheels, a facility which enables it to be crabbed into position in tight situations. The crane combines its 90-tonne lifting capacity with a fully-extended reach of 67 metres. An onboard computer in the driver's cab provides instant on-screen information about various lift/load configurations. A cut-off device is automatically activated in the event of an overload. Services engineer Jim Hunter, who is responsible for vehicle and plant maintenance on the terminal, told BPXpress: The remote location of Sullom Voe means that having a reliable crane is essential.

 But the most significant point to make is that to attempt to force the fabliaux to fit some standard rhetorical classification is not just (perhaps) irrelevant, but, more seriously, distracting in respect of the frequently clever and significant exploitation of language in these texts. In a fabliau called La Saineresse, The female blood-letter, for instance, the deceptive actions performed by the deceiving character are actions entirely of speech, as a wife who has had sexual intercourse with a man her dull-witted husband believes to be a female blood-letter describes her act of illicit fornication to her duped and satisfied husband entirely in metaphors:  (Sir, thank you by the love of God, I have indeed been in hard labour. I could not be bled and have been dealt more than a hundred blows so that I got a thorough grinding.) A nice example of sophisticated linguistic play lies at the heart of Cele qui fu foutue et desfoutue: a tale in which a beautiful young woman, locked away in a tower by her jealous father, one day desires to buy a bird (a  <head>crane</head> ) from a young man passing by, and is told it will cost a foutre, a fuck.

(7) I'm writing to say I'm having a marvellous time here  The gestural usage must be glossed a little differently, as the pragmatically given space, proximal to speaker's location at CT, that includes the point or location gesturally indicated.

He had obtained the auctioneer's catalogue only a day before the sale and the purported effect of the clause was to relieve the sellers from telling more than a part of the material facts, thereby obliging the buyer to check the remainder for himself. There are suggestions in the judgment that the decision would have been otherwise had the buyer been a property speculator. This allows a court to adjust its decision according to the other party involved.

While recognising that these were a strong portfolio of major brands, we acknowledged that the business had moved away from TISL's core development area.  <head>crane</head>  company doubles its size with Lilley buy By Peter Woodifield BUSINESS EDITOR WELDEX International Offshore, Scotland's leading crawler-crane hire company, has more than doubled in size after buying Piper Plant (Scotland), a subsidiary of the collapsed Lilley group. Weldex paid Price Waterhouse, the receiver, nearly 1 million for the business, which had a turnover of 5 million last year. Doug McGilvray, Weldex's managing director, said that at a stroke, the move had removed its biggest competitor in Scotland and doubled its own crane-hire fleet. In terms of general plant, Piper was bigger than us, while we were larger than them as crane operators, he said.

On completion of the project, the facility will be used to handle a new Liverpool-Dublin freight container service. Cargo discharged from the vessel Ruth-W was the first handled by the new CCL terminal. The facility expands the shipping line's operations because Coastal, bought by the MDHC in the summer of 1991, already has a Belfast terminal for its successful daily lift-on lift-off container service to Liverpool. On completion of a  <head>crane</head>  refurbishment programme and the modification of lifting facilities, Coastal now plans to inaugurate a Dublin-Liverpool container service before the end of the year.

ANOTHER example of the investment in Courtaulds Chemicals' Buckhaven site in Scotland is pictured being hoisted into position. The vessel, affectionately known as a scrubber, is a reactor that ensures no gas by-products from chemical processes are vented to the atmosphere. The large capacity of the reactor means gases can be scrubbed more quickly, removing a bottleneck and allowing the production process to operate more quickly. Installation involved hoisting the reactor by  <head>crane</head>  and gently lowering it into a prefabricated steel structure.

The Port Royal was not available until the end of March so we were asked to mobilise the Safe Holmia and another flotel the Polyconfidence first. This initial mobilisation was carried out at the beginning of March with all staff receiving company induction, full food hygiene training and safety induction and familiarisation on board the two installations. Then at the end of March we had to repeat the process, transferring all personnel equipment, housekeeping supplies and food from the Polyconfidence to the Port Royal. Equipment and supplies had to be packed into containers and transferred by  <head>crane</head> .

Public consultation and consideration of the draft strategy was carried out in November and December and the CIT were invited to take part in this process. The Northern Regional Officer, in association with the Chairman of the North Western and Merseyside Sections and a working group of their members, has responded to the consultation draft.  Four giant cranes have been given a lift ten miles down the River Mersey to start a new life working in the Port of Liverpool. The floating  <head>crane</head>  Mersey Mammoth carried the dismantled Liebherr gantry cranes and rail mounted transtainers to the Coastal Container Terminal at Royal Seaforth Dock.
