Another Collio white of real class is the 1990 Pinot Bianco from Vittorio and Giovanni Puiatti (91.16 from Winecellars 081 871 3979). The Pinot Bianco grape usually shows more character than the Pinot Grigio. In the hands of Puiatti, this Pinot Bianco is a stunning wine with a tight vinous concentration and considerable elegance  and is a real rival to top-flight St Vran which costs much the same. Try it with grilled sea  <head>bass</head>  and fennel.

It goes without saying that you start with the bottom step, to prevent the concrete falling through to the one below. Once filled, the sides and riser were gently tapped with a hammer for a couple of minutes to expel trapped air, which can cause surface voids. As each tread was scraped flush and tamped, we moved up to the next; when the surface water had run off, the step could be finished. We made the non-slip surfaces by stippling the tops with a  <head>bass</head>  broom  a fairly new one works best.

Like many young American composers he studied with Nadia Boulanger, but after 1925 set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found in Stein's writings. When he collaborated directly with her in opera the result was of historical significance. First came Four Saints in Three Acts, produced in 1934, and then The Mother of Us All (1947), which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage works of Philip Glass. In Four Saints Thomson's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then, when it stuck, wrote it down to a figured  <head>bass</head> .

Ives's Three Places in New England also had a philosophical, meditative character, rather than a passionate or temperamental one. The march tunes heaped up with proper brashness and a wild final acceleration, but the collage until then kept a rare sense of harmonic direction.

The ingredients were just right: three highly intelligent soloists (Lynne Dawson, Anthony Rolfe Johnson and David Wilson-Johnson); a small but alert choir (excellently trained by Julian Clarkson); a top-name period-instrument orchestra; and a conductor not afraid to cherish every aspect of Haydn's extraordinary score. This was music-making of a high order. Mackerras's account was compassionate but redblooded, direct but full of charm. It did not set out to be radically different, though Haydn's colourful scoring was certainly enhanced by the use of period instruments (including a fortepiano in the recitatives and a  <head>bass</head>  line reinforced more consistently by bass trombone and contra bassoon), but it succeeded in being unforced and unfettered.

With modern knowledge, we now know that this design of horn would have reflected more sound than it captured! For years, the technique was kinder to the voice than to most musical instruments.

Both the extreme  <head>bass</head>  and the extreme treble were lost, so most of the standard drum-kit (which normally provides the rhythm above and below the pitch of the instruments carrying the melody) was banned from the studio.

As a result Camberwell was at this time one of the most fertile art schools in Britain. One who arrived soon after the war ended, to study illustration on an ex-serviceman's grant, was Humphrey Lyttelton. His pen-and-ink drawings provided Minton with unrelieved amusement, as Lyttelton has recalled:  Humphrey Lyttelton's presence at Camberwell helped make it a centre for the beginnings of trad, a jazz revival which replaced the polite and effete noise which had hitherto passed for genuine jazz with a new vitality and energy. At Camberwell Bobby Hunt formed the Bob Hunt's Ragtime Band (Bobby on trumpet, Oska on trombone, Monty Sunshine on clarinet, Terry Arthurs on piano and Denis (Pip) Piper on a one-string  <head>bass</head>  made out of a wooden box and a broomhandle) and which rehearsed at lunchtime in the pottery room, Minton helping some of its members to buy their instruments. So they tried to revive their warlike spirits, while the women rubbed and slapped their heavy limbs and applied ointments to the survivors' burns and bruises. It was full dawn, a silver-grey dawn of the late days of spring, and it was still cool by the water's edge. The wounded who were carried in from the attack on the Rebecca  lay in the shade under the trees while their hurts were being dressed. By the creek, the main force of the islands' fighters was gathered for the simultaneous assault on Belmont, which was shaking the ground even at this range, like the bass drum of a ceremonial band.

The Agnus is naturally the culminating variation; in Misericorde the four parts are expanded for it to six. Even when the highest part of a secular model was more obviously tuneful than that of Misericorde au martir amoureulx  as we shall see, such songs were very fashionable in Paris at this time and the composer took few pains to disguise it (e.g. Gombert's Mass Je suys dshrite on a chanson attributed in the earliest source, Attaingnant's Trente chansons musicales (Paris, 1533) to Lupi, in later ones to Pierre Cadac), the  incongruence evidently did not disconcert contemporaries. Clemens was not content to borrow Pierre Sandrin's very popular Doulce memoire (first published in the first book of Moderne's Le Parangon des chansons (Lyons, 1538)) for the Sicut erat of his first Magnificat Primi Toni; he based every section of his Magnificat Octavi Toni on a chanson, actually drawing attention to their titles in his superius part:  The first five notes of Clemens's  <head>bass</head>  are indeed those of the plainsong eighth-tone Magnificat, but his superius is identical with that of Sermisy's C'est une dure despartie except that it does not follow Sermisy's repeat of the first two phrases and does repeat his last phrase.

Is it possible to observe formal principles with a mind preoccupied with spontaneous composition? It is certainly difficult to improvise well and keep to precise forms, because this means being able to remember and replay what we have played before. Nevertheless, it is important to achieve a semblance of coherent form. There are a few solutions, such as improvisation on a ground  <head>bass</head> , on a theme, or using a skeleton harmonic framework as in jazz.

Very high altitudes can also be attained by the employment of natural and artificial harmonics, but here again the use of these is the exception rather than the rule, and a good deal of practical knowledge of string technique is required for their safe and appropriate use. Those who wish to avail themselves of all the different kinds of harmonics possible will find the information they require in the larger text books of orchestration. We are more concerned here with what might be called the roast beef of scoring than with the confectionery. The normal layout of the string orchestra is in four-part harmony, the double  <head>bass</head>  either doubling the cellos or being silent. We would here stress the importance of giving plenty of rests to the double basses. Few things are more fatiguing to the ear than the incessant doubling of the bass at the octave below, in season and out of season. No organist in his senses would use sixteen-foot tone throughout an extended work, so why should the orchestrator? We would advise the beginner never to write his cello and bass parts on the same stave: if he does, he will almost surely fall into the error of over-using the double bass, his mind's ear, which acts through his eye, being almost certain to fail to register the lower octave. Moreover, we do not wish to give the impression that the cello and bass always work in double harness: on the contrary, they can be used independently to a quite large extent, though discretion and careful thought are very necessary in this matter, since the basses when used alone tend to sound rather dry, and if their part lies low and is far removed in pitch from the rest of the harmony it is too indeterminate in pitch to give satisfactory support unless it consists of a sustained or better (since the bow is short) a reiterated pedal note. In a quiet harmonic passage, however, in which the bass does not lie extremely low, the double basses may be entrusted with the lowest part. Always think how the passage would look if the bass were written at its true pitch instead of an octave higher.

There's also, of course, an output for a pair of stereo speakers that is capable of providing 4 watts per channel and a joystick interface. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink! Sound Quality The synthesis of musical sounds is taken care of by a Yamaha sound chipset capable of stereo output with  <head>bass</head>  and treble equalisation. To get the best out of this setup, it's best to use a decent pair of speakers  the better they are, the better the sound quality. Without getting into the Hi-Fi magazines' territory, using a pair of dual cone active speakers, the sound quality from the on-board synthesiser is very pleasant, with few harsh tones and a definite bass boost being audible. In DOS mode, bass and treble are controlled by a command line mixing facility called PAS which allows the user to control not only the overall volume, but also the relative volumes of mic input, digitised output, synthesiser output, CD output and bass and treble.

The bedroom door had burst open and Peter was striding into the room. In a dream, she saw him skid to a halt, taking in the scene at once as it must have appeared  his brother bending over his fiance  and, thought Sarella in dismay, taking in my submissive expression as I stupidly allow this dark monster to maul me. Furious with herself for allowing such a situation, she pushed Marc's hand away, panting slightly with suppressed emotion at the misunderstandings she knew must follow. A look of confusion had flashed across Peter's face, then he gave a short laugh, a more boyish version of his brother's cynical  <head>bass</head> , and said, So you two are getting to know each other.

The voice that is always compared to the young Sinatra, and always comes out better in the comparison stayed mostly out of the limelight as Harry let his sixteen piece band do the talking. And could they talk! With a brass section that cheerfully joined in any chorus they could remember complete with formation instrument swaying and excellent drums, double  <head>bass</head>  and guitar, it was easy to see that this band have been all over the world together.

Middlesbrough Town Hall RIDE grew up a lot in public in 1990 a year when bands like themselves and the Charlatans made it very big, very quickly. The floppy fringes and pouting lips of the respective lead singers are another story entirely. Ride do not seem to have developed very much since then, just quietly maturing into a dependable guitar band. Certainly, few of their contemporaries can get the range and quality of tunes from the classic  <head>bass</head> , guitars and drums line-up.

From the opening numbers, Stan Barker's BOB Blues and a roaring version of Broadway, the two leaders were at the top of their form. Their careers together go back to the 1960s with Alex Welsh with a later spell with with Humphrey Lyttelton and they obviously relished the chance to play together again. They've also completed a 15 day tour of the North with the Stan Barker Trio and had honed up playing together. For this one date they were supported by the Billy Harper Trio with Peter Stuart and Adrian Tilbrook on  <head>bass</head>  and drums and they fitted in as if they'd all been on tour together.

For this tour the final line-up had Dave Lewis on saxes, Les Miller double  <head>bass</head> , and guitarist Chris Watson who replaced the previously announced Hammond organist.

Two composers have had three commissions supported  the young Edinburgh composer, Kenneth Dempster, who will write works for the Hebrides Ensemble and the Leda Piano Trio, and the established Glasgow composer and folk musician, Edward McGuire, who has  commissions  from the Chamber Group of Scotland, the Silver Duo, and from the  Mendelssohn  on Mull Festival, for a work with local children. The SAC, keen to spread its awards over different parts of the country, and to encourage a wide range of musical initiatives, has also supported commissions from amateur organisations  the Cunninghame Choir, Dalkeith Symphony Orchestra, the Meadows Chamber Orchestra, and the Scottish Chamber Choir. There is also encouragement for young composers  support for work from Jane Gardner, from James Dillon, this for a work for his fellow composer/pianist James Clapperton, from David Horne, currently studying in the United States, and from Magnus Robb, presently a pupil of Louis Andriessen in the Hague. The range of commissions is formidable  from chamber works to concertos, piano studies for teaching purposes to works for free- <head>bass</head>   accordion , and for Northumbrian pipes.
