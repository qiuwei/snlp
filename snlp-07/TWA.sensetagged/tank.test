Creating a vortex For waste collection in my workshop I use a Hoover Wet/Dry Powervac Super, fitted with a pleated paper drum filter and connected to my tools and machines with flexible hoses. I also use the vac in the garden, collecting leaves, grass and hedge clippings. But by using an auxiliary collecting  <head>tank</head>  I am able to increase the capacity by more than eight time, thereby avoiding having the empty the vac so frequently. I acquired a 1301 plastic tank (the kind with a removable lid which is retained in position with a ring clamp) and installed inlet and outlet hose sockets in the sides close to the top at diagonally opposite points. The hose sockets were the genuine parts supplied with the Powervac. These required a little modification to get a better fit around the radius of the tank, sealing with a glue gun. If ordinary drainage fittings are used it is vital that the inner parts of both inlet and outlet are passed through a 90 elbow to create a vortex. The tank's lid is so good that the suction is enough to seal it, with the ring clamp.

There's no need to nail the shelves down, as they can't move sideways because of the spacers. Except for the few slats supporting the tank, all the shelves in the cupboard can be removed in a moment, making access really easy.

By DAVID KEYS The 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War has largely been an armchair affair, commemorated in newspapers and magazines, on the radio and television. However, outside your sitting room thousands of wartime military installations still survive as historically important reminders of Britain's epic struggle. Fighter and Bomber Command airfields, anti  <head>tank</head>  defences, gun emplacements, prisoner of war camps  and some 6,000 pillboxes still form part of the landscape in many areas of the country. In the heart of London's Whitehall visitors can explore the warren of cramped underground rooms and passageways which served as the nerve centre of Britain's war effort. Known as the Cabinet War Rooms, the complex has only been open to the public since 1983. Inside, one can still see the Map Room, where Churchill used to study the progress of the war, the Cabinet Room where many of the Second World War's most important decisions were made, and Churchill's personal accommodation from which he made several of his wartime broadcasts. In the space of 12 months the War Office built 25,000 pillboxes  almost a quarter of which still survive  and erected hundreds of miles of concrete anti-tank defences. On windswept lonely Chesil Beach  that great ten mile long pile of pebbles which stretches westwards along the Dorset coast from Portland  one can still explore the pillboxes and anti-tank defences which were built in 1940 to resist the threat of invasion. And later in the war, in 1943, it was this imposing natural wall of shingle which was used by the famous Dambusters as a practice target before their attack on the Mohne and Eder dams in Germany. Fifty miles inland, the remains of the wartime government's fall-back line of defence still survives, mostly along the line of the Kennett-Avon canal. Between Bradford-on-Avon and Reading are some 200 pillboxes built in 1940 to house mobile two pound anti-tank guns and machine guns in the event of invasion. The recesses in the pillbox floors where the guns would have fitted are still there today. The various different types of pillbox can be seen from the canal towpath. Larger scale gun emplacements, however, are much rarer. The only surviving group of such installations can be explored at Curry Mallet near Taunton, Somerset, where three large gun emplacements with three-foot-thick concrete walls were built to house six-pounder anti-tank guns with a range of half a mile.

Soviet threat to 3bn pounds anti- <head>tank</head>  missile projects By MARK URBAN, Defence Correspondent BRITAIN'S plans for a new generation of anti-tank weapons, involving projects costing more than 3bn, could be thrown into turmoil after the discovery of new armour on Soviet tanks. Ministry of Defence sources say that two of the Army's three new anti-tank missiles will be ineffective against the frontal armour of new Soviet tanks. Warsaw Pact tanks have been fitted in recent years with additional armour, designed to explode when hit by an anti-tank missile, so neutralising its effect. This is called reactive armour. The Army's new anti-tank weapons are being designed with tandem warheads; the first explodes reactive armour and the second penetrates the shell of the tank. Now it has emerged that Soviet tanks are being fitted with two or three layers of the reactive armour, which probably renders the tandem warhead ineffective. Les Aspin, a member of the US Congress and chairman of the powerful Armed Services Committee, said he had a nasty surprise when he saw Soviet tanks fitted with the multi-layer reactive armour during a visit to the Ukraine in August. In the latest Jane's Defence Weekly, he says this discovery can't be anything but bad news to forces planning to defend against these tanks with current anti-tank weapons. The Army is taking delivery of LAW-80, a short range anti-tank weapon costing 400m. But it cannot penetrate the frontal armour of new Soviet tanks, MoD sources say. Britain is collaborating with France and West Germany, in a project called Trigat, to develop medium and long range anti-tank missiles. The cost to Britain is 780m and 1.85bn respectively. Medium range Trigat has been designed with a tandem warhead and is due to enter service in the mid-1990s. It will be ineffective against the multi-layer reactive armour, experts say. Long range Trigat is being designed to make a diving attack on the roof of a tank, where the armour is normally at its weakest. Explosive reactive armour, which is fitted in box-shaped panels, has been fixed to the turret roof of modern Soviet tanks. The long range weapon is not due to enter service until the late 1990s and may be delayed while scientists attempt to modify the warhead to defeat the multi-layered Soviet armour. Further delays could have a serious effects on Army plans to introduce a fleet of gunship anti-tank helicopters, for which the long range Trigat is intended to be the primary weapon. The MoD may be forced to incur further costs by buying another anti-tank missile as an interim solution until the long range Trigat is ready. Some officers familiar with the medium range Trigat project are sceptical that it can be modified to defeat the new armour. They believe Britain should pull out of the project and find another weapon to fill the same role. Reactive armour has hardly any effect on the solid, armour-piercing rounds fired from tank guns. The new development may strengthen, therefore, the case of those who back the early replacement of the Army's Chieftain tank fleet.

However, staying for a moment with hi-jacking, here we have a specialised form of the Breakthrough Phenomenon, which until the antidote is produced or produces itself, has quite startling pyrotechnic results, but collapses again as the antidote is devised.

A crushing piece of condescension that, worthy of a Spanish grandee in about 1700, too proud to notice that the world has moved on.

Franco-German battles are fought with press release, not  <head>tank</head>  division, and the general idea is to keep the Huns firmly inside French territory  not the other way round.

His original idea was to appoint four peers, which is how they acquired the nickname overlords. One, John Anderson, Viscount Waverley, a wartime Chancellor and Lord President, was to be Lord Privy Seal and overlord for supply and raw materials and of the Treasury and Board of Trade. He declined the offer. Three of the peers accepted: Lord Woolton, the hugely successful wartime Minister of Food and begetter of Woolton Pies, became Lord President, with responsibility for co-ordinating the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food; Lord Leathers, former Minister of War Transport, became overlord for the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Fuel and Power; Lord Cherwell, the Prof, Churchill's personal boffin in wartime, returned to his old post of Paymaster General with responsibility for co-ordinating work on the Bomb, scientific research and development generally, and Churchill's revived personal think- <head>tank</head> , the Statistical Branch.

When I learned one day that an amateur American flyer had set the world's record in altitude for a single-engined aircraft, carrying two to a height of more than 18,000 feet, I saw the possibility of a news story if I could beat that record. Dick Ryan, who was a real pal of mine not only because he was such a good all-round chap, but also because he was a teacher of English Literature at Ross Collegiate, thought so too.

For example it is reported that overstocking in litter-based poultry will result in an overloaded offensive litter; whilst understocking may also be undesirable, since this may result in a dry and dusty litter which may help disperse the odour over a wide area, unless dust filters are installed. With regard to the storage of manure, the effect on odour development depends on whether the manure is in solid or liquid form, and whether it is stored aerobically, that is with a sufficient supply of oxygen, or anaerobically, that is in septic conditions, in the absence of oxygen. Solid manure stores, carefully sited and tended, are less likely to give rise to nuisance problems than is liquid storage in the form of a slurry. It is usual for a crust to form on the surface of the storage  <head>tank</head> , the sludge settling to the bottom with the liquid in the middle. This crust prevents odours escaping and hence reduces odour emission. Unfortunately, its formation can cause problems, the solids sometimes remaining unpumpable on the bottom of the tank.

In particular, it attempts to assess how rational decision-makers will act in certain situations: It takes the tools of economics and applies them to the material of politics. By applying logical, deductive reasoning, economists try to work out what a rational actor would do to maximize his sic chance of getting what he wants (McLean, 1987, p. 1), that is, to maximize his or her utility. It is a very powerful weapon in the hands of critics of bureaucracy.

During the 1960's Noam Chomsky popularised the view that human languages together share certain universal grammatic features, and that language is not learnt from scratch but rather acquired by brain centres sensitive to this underlying syntax. Since the anatomical asymmetries of human language areas first appear in utero , the implication is that preliminary stages of language acquisition could begin before birth. TECHNOLOGY Computerised  <head>tank</head>  outshoots its rivals THE Royal Ordnance Factory at Leeds yesterday delivered to the British Army the first production version of the Challenger tank, less than three years after the Ministry of Defence ordered the vehicle.The army is receiving more than 200 Challengers, costing about 300 million, to beef up its defences in Germany against Soviet tanks. The Challenger, with its Chobham composite armour, is the best-protected tank in the world and can also outshoot its  Eastern  -bloc counterparts. The MOD ordered Challenger when the tank that it had been developing, known as MBT80 turned out to be too complicated and expensive. Much of the development work that found its way into Challenger had been under way for some years on behalf of the Shah of Iran. After the Shah's fall, the Iranian government cancelled plans to buy more than 1200 Shir 11 tanks from the Leeds factory, which saw its order book fall from 1000 million to 30 million overnight. The Shir 11 was an improved version of the British Army's standard Chieftain tank. When MBT80 fell by the wayside, the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment at Chobham modified the design and came up with Challenger. Modern shells and anti-tank guided missiles can, if they hit a vulnerable point, penetrate the conventional hardened steel armour that protects Chieftain and its crew. The Chobham establishment therefore redesigned the hull and turret for the next version, Challenger. The new armour is heavy, and a Challenger weighs a massive 60 tonnes. Despite this, it is comparatively sprightly for a tank. The Rolls-Royce Condor diesel engine produces 900 kW of power, sufficient to drive the vehicle at more than 70 km/h across Salisbury Plain during trials last autumn. No previous tank could operate effectively at anything like that speed across rough country without the risk of injuring the crew. Challenger is the first tank with hydrogas suspension, which gives a much smoother ride. Challenger's 12 independent hydrogas units allow the wheels to travel up and down much further than with Chieftain's  bogie  -type suspension, thus greatly reducing the accelerations that the vehicle itself undergoes. Crew comfort is greatly improved as a result, and Challenger is a much more stable gun platform when firing on the move. A computer controls Challenger's gun, so it can shoot accurately at moving tanks, even when the vehicle is itself driving across country. Sensors on the tank measure wind speed and direction, air temperature and other factors that affect a shell's behaviour on its way to the target. The gunner looks through his optical sight, lines it up with an enemy tank and squeezes a trigger to fire a laser that measures the range. Information about the target's position passes automatically to the computer, which calculates where the gun should point so that its shell will hit the target. The computer then instructs motors to slew the turret and raise the gun barrel by the appropriate amount. Challenger has a good chance of hitting a Soviet tank with its first shell at a distance of more than 2000 m. The new tank's gun, of 120 mm calibre, is the same as that fitted to Chieftain. It will be more effective, though, thanks to a shell that has fins to stabilise it during flight. As the shell emerges from the gun barrel at more than 15000 m/s, aluminium petals peel away to reveal a long, thin tungsten-alloy rod with fins at the rear to stabilise it and thus improve accuracy. This long-rod penetrator punches a hole through the armour of an enemy tank, destroying equipment inside and killing or disabling the crew.

The only way to test these predictions in the space of a few years is to observe a sufficient number of protons and see if a few decay. The experiment in the Morton salt Mine in Ohio is one of a number set up around the world to do just this. The apparatus in the salt mine, designed mainly by physicists from the Universities of California (Irvine) and Michigan and the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, is deceptively simple. A specially-mined hole lined with plastic forms a  <head>tank</head>  for nearly 10 000 tonnes of water, or in the region of 10 33  protons. The water is viewed by light sensitive detectors designed to pick up the so-called Cherenkov light emitted when electrically-charged particles travel faster than light does through the water. If a proton decays, its products should produce tell-tale patterns of Cherenkov light on the walls of the tank.

The list of diseases that slurry could spread is a formidable one, including anthrax and tetanus, but the one that receives most attention is salmonellosis. The institute reports that 10 per cent of cattle slurries and 23 per cent of pig slurries are contaminated with salmonellas  even if the animals themselves are healthy. Fortunately, salmonellas die rapidly in storage, although they can survive if the temperature stays below 10C, and if the slurry contains more than 5 per cent solids. After a month of storage in a  <head>tank</head>  or lagoon, the slurry should be safe enough for spreading  although cattle should not graze on it for a month.

That's what my, I say my father bred er pigs and supplied the Ministry of Food and I can remember that he had a contract to collect all the erm waste from schools in the area. But erm they say that he had used to go and collect it and that was what was fed to the pigs.

Similarly, I didn't want any obvious arms on it so I had to work out a system of manipulators  things that did things, like a grip mechanism or a gun.

Whilst the human studies had suggested a role for the hippocampus in the transition between short- and long-term declarative memory  a role supported by study of hippocampal lesions in monkeys  another facet of the hippocampus's role in memory was being uncovered in rats. Here, one of the striking effects of lesions is to affect the animal's capacity to learn spatial tasks  for instance to run mazes. Although this effect had been shown previously with more traditional maze-learning tasks, the best demonstration came in a test devised by Richard Morris, then of St Andrews, now at Edinburgh. The equipment consists of a circular, high-sided  <head>tank</head> , a couple of metres in diameter, filled with warm water which is made cloudy by adding some milk. The tank is located in a room whose walls contain recognizable  orienting cues; thus on the north wall there may be a clock, on the south a source of light, on the east an animal cage and so forth. At one point in the tank there is a shelf just below the water level, but invisible because of the cloudiness. A rat, put in the tank, swims at random until it locates the shelf, more or less accidentally, and climbs onto it. A video camera mounted above the tank can track the route taken by the swimming animal.

Indeed, I was far more worried than she because the Seayak she was using had no storage tanks (these are Prijon's replacement for the more usual bulkhead system, the latter being very hard to make watertight in plastic boats) and no pump. We would have had a real problem emptying the Seayak in that swell. X rescues or similar out because of the Seayak's loaded weight and bailing would have been a very frustrating experience beam on in that sea; a flexible hose from another boat's pump would have worked but mine was glassed in! So, I would want to test the storage  <head>tank</head>  and pump system (and the rudder assembly) before unreservedly recommending the Seayak even for short open sea crossings.

Relaxing music is played at the beginning of the float and again at the end to indicate your time is up. There's a light switch near at hand inside that tank and, as you are wearing ear plugs, you find yourself floating in a soundless, dark and warm environment. Jacqueline certainly found her float relaxing, I drifted in and out of awareness and felt stress and tension ease away, she explained. But I think anyone who's sensitive to enclosed spaces could find a flotation tank claustrophobic. But I personally would do it again. The Raphael Clinic,  .

One pitfall has been the temptation to adopt a lowest common denominator approach to unit length and course delivery, leading to a set of central modular regulations which, in their efforts to retain local features of individual cases, present the student with an overall scheme of mind-boggling complexity. There are several such phantom modular courses around, which in their presentation to applicants and to enrolled students of a unified title (Critical studies', Combined studies, etc.) imply promises (of internal transfer, for example) which they then cannot deliver.  Other key points within the conversion strategy include the implications for the course or department of opting in (what controls, for example, are relinquished over admissions, timetabling, examining, or future resource planning?) and the significance for contributing departments of continuing non-modular work. One possibility, usually disastrous for the development of the wider course in terms of resource constraints, is the header- <head>tank</head>  model, where departments with strong freestanding courses resource and develop these first before turning to the faculty- or polytechnic-wide scheme.

A second  antecedent could be found in work by engineers, and R.A.

In contrast to neighbouring Cuxton, where a most important Palaeolithic site was discovered in 1962, the prehistory of Hailing as known at present can only be shown to date from Neolithic, or New Stone Age, times. In this connection it is perhaps significant that the boundary between the parish and Snodland was the old track or Ridgeway, now largely destroyed by chalk quarries, which, keeping to the highest and driest line over the downs is thought to have formed the main east-west route at this period, crossing the River Medway at Holborough as Mr Margery suggested. Beside the Ridgeway and effectively parallel to it as a lower level ran the Terrace-way, here called by the later name of Pilgrims' Way, which passes through Upper and North Hailing to a crossing presumably in the Rochester area. Our earliest known inhabitant, Hailing Man, is now securely dated by the radiocarbon method to about 2000 B.C. His skeleton came to light in August 1912 when workmen were excavating for a sewage  <head>tank</head>  behind the railway station.

This level of command was fixed ie as General Dwight Eisenhower you would not be expected to fly planes into combat, nor as the jockey of a M1 Abrams tank could you try and effect changes in grand strategy.

It was the first time that four large tanks  two crude storage, a ballast water and the Brent surge  had been taken out of service for planned maintenance in one year. The programme, which started in February, was handled by a taskforce of experienced operators, referred to on-site as Dad's Army. Many of the 16-strong team have now  or will have by the end of this month  taken early retirement. Mechanical contractors for the crude tanks 2045 and 2055 and the ballast water tank 3015 were Motherwell Bridge, the company which originally constructed the storage tanks. Motherwell Bridge's site manager Jim Anderson explained that his workforce of welders, platers and fitters peaked at 31, with subcontract work undertaken by tank cleaning contractor Caltech and painting contractor Wilkie Hooke. The job required 51,000 man-hours over a 28-week period, he said. Shetland Engineers Limited were involved with the Brent surge tank refurbishment.

Similarly, in Aldridge v. Johnson (1857 Q.B.) where the buyer supplied bags for the seller to put the goods (barley) into, it was held that property passed when the seller filled the bags. An easy and neat example of assent can also be found in the case of a purchase of petrol at a garage. If a petrol pump attendant puts the petrol into the customer's car, that is an unconditional appropriation to which the buyer's assent is clearly implied, Edwards v. Ddin (1976 D.C.). At a self-service garage it is the motorist who unconditionally appropriates the petrol by pouring it into his  <head>tank</head> , the assent of the seller being equally clearly implied. Thus at a self-service station, as in the case of a non self-service one, property in the petrol passes to the buyer when it is poured into his tank, R. v. McHugh (1977 D.C.).

Increased spending was requested for major strategic weapons systems, including increases of 2,900 million for SSN-21 nuclear powered submarines, 1,600 million for the previously beleaguered anti-missile Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), and 4,800 million for four more B-2 stealth bombers. The last two projects were expected to meet stiff congressional resistance. In addition the navy was to receive a new aircraft carrier and the army and air force would get the LH helicopter and an advanced tactical fighter aircraft, among a new generation of high technology systems expected to be partly financed by the termination of many existing systems. Programmes to be cancelled or phased out (subject to post-Gulf war evaluation) included the navy's F-14D fighter aircraft and Trident submarine, the airforce's Maverick missile and F-15E and F-16 fighter aircraft and the army's M-1  <head>tank</head> , Apache helicopter and Bradley fighting vehicle; the remaining two US battleships, Missouri and Wisconsin, were both set to be decommissioned in September 1991.

United States President Bush said on June 1 that an agreement in principle on Soviet compliance with the November 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty cleared the way for an important step towards a super-power summit. Earlier that day, US Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh had met for talks in Lisbon, focusing on Soviet requests for economic assistance see p. 38272, on prospects for a Middle East peace conference and on the CFE issue. Neither Baker nor Bessmertnykh elaborated on how their CFE agreement was reached, but Baker stressed later that it respected the full integrity and credibility of the treaty. The US side had hitherto accused the Soviet military of evading the impact of CFE force reductions, in particular by transferring  <head>tank</head>  units east of the Urals (i.e. simply removing them from the area covered by the treaty, rather than destroying them see pp. 38027; 38122; 38217).

As the east European member states of the former Warsaw Pact and Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA, or Comecon) continued to experience severe economic difficulties in their transition to free-market systems, concerns were expressed during January and February at a series of incidents in which arms manufactured by those countries were supplied to Middle Eastern countries, apparently in contravention of the existing multilateral arms control provisions. German officials reported on Jan. 29 that a German freighter, the Godewind, bound from Szczecin in Poland for Syria, had been found to be carrying 16 Czechoslovak-made T-72 tanks for the Syrian armed forces, apparently in contravention of the Czechoslovak government's promise to end such transactions. The vessel was intercepted in the Mediterranean by the German navy and escorted to the German port of Kiel where its cargo was impounded. The incident aroused official protests from both Syria and Czechoslovakia, which claimed that the  <head>tank</head>  shipment formed part of a 252-tank deal approved by the Czechoslovakian authorities before the 1991 constraint agreement came into force. It was further reported on Feb. 2 that another 12 T-72 tanks had been loaded on a Danish freighter, the Nadia J, bound from Szczecin for Syria; it ran aground near the Danish port of Saeby and the tanks were seized by the Danish authorities, together with 46 tonnes of ammunition, on Feb. 3, giving rise to further protests from Syria. There were also persistent reports that Czechoslovak arms manufacturers were selling weapons to the Yugoslav federal forces, in contravention of UN policy. A Prague-based magazine, Respekt, reported in January that Yugoslavia was the intended recipient of some US1,500 million-worth of guns, rifles and anti-tank missiles ostensibly being sold to Nigeria.
