Along this fiery path and valley, the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided, lift themselves in dark, indefinite, fantastic forms, each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam Purple and blue, the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night, which gathers cold and low, advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea, its thin mast written upon the sky, in lines of blood I believe, if I were reduced to rest Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose this. Its daring conception, ideal in the highest sense of the word, is based on the purest truth, and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life, its colour is almost perfect, not one false or morbid hue in any part or line, and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition; its drawing is as accurate as fearless; the ship buoyant, bending, and full of  <head>motion</head> ; its tones as true as they are wonderful; and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions the power, majesty and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable sea.

I had gone too far and  experienced too much, I needed to slow down, to get back to the small things, the practical things, to measuring and cutting and fixing, and it was with relief that I noticed that daylight had begun to invade the room, I kept quite still, I held the glass firmly in my gaze, gradually the elements already worked on began to emerge, some more clearly than others, some in outline only and some only when they impeded the free flow of light through the glass, until the sun came up and was reflected back from the windows of the house opposite and I could sit and look at the glass and think back through the work and the mistakes and the few successes, and sense again with that sickening feeling in the pit of the stomach that the whole of the right hand side of the lower panel was still a mess, nothing there had been resolved, but then I drew back from that, though it kept trying to pull me back to itself, and concentrated on what was beginning to work, on the left hand areas both top and bottom and on the elegance of the frame and the joy of seeing the bare walls and the wainscoting appear through the empty areas, and as I moved round so different parts of the room appeared and the relation of the surface of the glass to what lay behind changed, precision and fluidity, precision and fluidity, he wrote, choice and chance, not choice alone and chance alone but the two together, that is why delay, not stoppage and not flow but delay, delay in glass, he wrote, as when the plane is late and you should have been gone, have already arrived perhaps, but you are still there, or the sprinter beats the gun and the whole field is called back, the race could have been over but it has not yet started.

Institutions have the pathetic megalomania of the computer whose whole vision of the world is its own programme. This extremely perceptive analysis of the institutional mind fits the police world like a glove, and recent elaborations in policing, along with its growth in the mainstream of the daily social process, supports Douglas's contention (ibid.) that an institution which is dependent upon authority can only demand more of the  same. In such ontological circumstances this allegedly public service must be singularly unsuited to objective assessment of any external demands for a reduction in its power or to encompassing any critical analysis which might cause loss of prestige. Given this premise, we should not be surprised to find the police are in the forefront of support for proposals such as the introduction of identity cards; it was not surprising to find the 1988 Superintendents' Association conference not only supporting this  <head>motion</head> , but arguing for the creation of twenty-four hour armed patrols throughout the country and making a plea for a national motorway squad.

So as the 1980s drew to a close, the sub-sectors dubbed Coal, Construction, Petroleum and Metals were all in fine shape, and their outlook for the 1990s is promising. Not that the eighties were without their problems: quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years, which affected all Railfreight's bulk traffics to some degree or other, there was the historic miners' strike of 19845, taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings. Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre-strike tonnages were exceeded, although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced. The merry-go-round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train remains in  <head>motion</head>  has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal's operations, and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative.

He is a better finisher than that, of course, and amends were duly made in the 43rd minute when he brought it to 2-0 on the night and 3-3 overall by meeting David Smith's low centre from the left with a 12-yard volley of stunning velocity. Understandably, given their numerical disadvantage, Grimsby made little headway in attack, although Alexander, at 6ft 4in, was of a nuisance value against a defence deprived by injury of Brian Kilcline's aerial authority.

Last week the first practical steps towards such a union were taken when leaders of the RPR, UDF and UDC met and agreed to form a tactical group to work out the most effective means of opposing the government. The first decision of this tactical group was not to table a motion of no confidence during the debate on the bill which sets this year's level of defence spending.

GEOFFREY BOYCOTT'S credibility as a member of Yorkshire's general committee was dented further yesterday when he left the emergency meeting an hour before the end, writes Derek Hodgson. Sid Fielden, an erstwhile ally and chairman of the county's public relations sub-committee said afterwards: I find his conduct difficult to understand and impossible to explain. The meeting had been called, in advance of the general monthly gathering, to investigate Yorkshire's dismal record last season and to discuss a suggestion by the captain, Phil Carrick, that players born outside the county be recruited. A  <head>motion</head>  calling for the signing of an overseas professional was rejected unanimously; only three votes were recorded in favour, one presumably Boycott's, of signing players born outside the county.

Timothy Renton, Minister of State at the Home Office, told the conference the Government would not push to legislate while neither shops nor shoppers could agree on a solution, pressure groups could not agree, and Parliament could find no consensus. Mr Renton said he hoped, maybe by the next conference, to have found agreement. But his emphasis on the opposition to options considered by the Home Office suggests there will be no Bill before a general election. On a show of hands, representatives rejected a  <head>motion</head>  against any legislation incompatible with the traditional character of Sunday.

The main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists, especially Alberti, Brunelleschi and Leonardo, who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space. When I first encountered de Santillana's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive. Its attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message, for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science.

Often their private non-political opinion is that the National Front are to be condemned as extremists; but since what the National Front is extreme about is racism, this implies that it is all right to be moderately racist. A reluctance to take a stand about racism, in fact indifference to it, has been shown again and again by head teachers. In December 1977 the Headmistress of St Anselm's School in Canterbury, one of Britain's leading Roman Catholic Comprehensives, allowed a teacher who was a National Front candidate to continue in her post alter she had promised that her National Front views would not affect her treatment to black pupils.

MP claims that Met fraud squad leaked Fraser report to Lonrho. By Daniel John THE copy of the confidential Department of Trade and Industry report into the House of Fraser takeover which was passed to the Observer newspaper was leaked by officers of the Metropolitan Police fraud squad, it was alleged yesterday. According to a House of Commons  <head>motion</head> , the leak was traced through a system of numbered copies of the 752-page document, which was sent out to the authorities investigating possible criminal proceedings resulting from the report's conclusions. Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, claims that the leak inquiry, which followed publication of parts of the report in a special edition of the Observer, discovered that copy 26 had been sent to the paper's owners, Lonrho. It is the first time the fraud squad has been directly accused of leaking the report. The MP's motion and three parliamentary questions directed at the Attorney-General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, allege the copy was given to the fraud squad to help its investigations into the successful 615million bid for Fraser by the Fayed brothers in 1985. Two fraud squad officers, Detective Inspector Graham Gooch and Detective Sergeant Ken Morgan, were sent out to Egypt as part of the investigation being conducted alongside an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. However, they were later taken off the case and transferred to other duties. Mr Campbell-Savours alleges that senior Scotland Yard officers then decided the team should not have any further contact with the Observer or Lonrho. But his motion adds: This House therefore questions why an officer chose to ignore that instruction by meeting the City editor of the Observer at least twice including on the eve of publication of the special edition. The motion goes on to say that it draws the natural and disturbing inference that the meetings and copy number 26 were linked.

It cannot be irrelevant to evangelism that so many unbelievers think the place we give to women in the Church is frankly absurd. He still feared polarisation and the creation of monochrome dioceses where clergy opposed to women priests would leave dioceses where they were ordained, and women ordinands and deacons would leave dioceses where they could not become priests. The legislation would have most impact on the dioceses, and Dr Runcie was anxious the debate should be extended to the grassroots. The  <head>motion</head>  was moved by the Rev Canon John Dale (Worcester) who said it was five years since the request for legislation on women priests was made. The measure as revised by the committee tried as hard as possible to accommodate the views of those who object to women priests. It creates space within the Church from which they can carry on their ministry for up to 20 years. Speaking against the motion, the Rev David Holloway (Newcastle) quoted a Canadian theologian. If it should turn out to be true that God did intend males to exhibit strength in leadership roles and females to excel more as the guardians of society's emotional resources, why should this be viewed ipso facto as an evil arrangement? Mr Michael Oakley (York), supporting the motion, said it was vital the matter was put out to the dioceses.

The motion states: To recruit almost exclusively from the narrow minority group of Guardian readers whose views are predominantly leftwing is contrary to the spirit of the obligations of political balance in broadcasting and is an explanation of the self-righteous and unctuous hostility of broadcasters towards the present Government.

The exceptionally deep body also gives us an indication of the action of a bream when feeding, and this knowledge will help tremendously when interpreting the action into terminal rigs and the timing of striking the hook home.

The First Plans for Rebuilding In 1822, Soane had prepared proposals for rebuilding Downing Street which omitted the Foreign Office and the houses opposite. Only the north side of the scheme was carried out in 18256 as the Privy Council Offices and the Board of Trade, and it was at the Treasury's instigation that Seward in 1833 produced a scheme to house various governmental offices in a block on the south side of the street, following Soane's lines.

As these sites are used up housebuilders have looked further afield to the small towns and villages of southern England which are now within commuting reach of London and the motorway-induced development radiating from it. Counties such as Berkshire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire have been faced with increasing government demands to provide more new housing and this has produced vociferous opposition from local residents who see their traditional communities under threat. Both high income commuters and lower income residents may resent development of this kind: the one because it interferes with their fantasy of the rural life, and the other because it pushes up house prices without providing any new job opportunities. Although some developers provide low cost or rented housing within their schemes, the majority of housing is aimed at the upper end of the market thus setting in  <head>motion</head>  a house price spiral which effectively freezes the locals out of home ownership.

The remedy granted by the High Court is an injunction, a discretionary remedy and a very serious one for the defendants, which may result in closure of the premises without compensation if that is the only way in which the nuisance can be abated. Courts are however reluctant to take any action which will close premises down, as evidenced by the Shoreham  and Cheltenham  cases, in which it was between four and five years after the issue of the original writ that the businesses were finally closed down. It is clear that time will be allowed for improvements to be carried out and only when it is clear that there is no prospect of the business in question being able to operate without causing an odour, which amounts to a statutory nuisance, will the court permit the issue of a writ of sequestration for contempt of court, in committing breaches of the undertaking not to cause a statutory nuisance, thus closing the business down without compensation. Michael Davis, J. who heard the  <head>motion</head>  by Shoreham-by-Sea Urban District Council, in the High Court, for an order that they be at liberty to issue writs of sequestration, held that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to satisfy the court that the defendants had acted wilfully in the sense of contumaciously, with a deliberate intention to defy the court order, since the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1965, do not contain in Order 45, Rule 5(1), the word wilful.

Inevitably, Lioretographs disappeared within three or four years. At the Paris exhibition of 1900 (the one at which Oscar Wilde is supposed to have been recorded), the Columbia company introduced their Multiplex Grand machine, using a giant cylinder played by three styli and horns. We can see from (47) that the cylinder had three soundtracks side-by-side; presumably it was recorded by three cutters side-by-side, in which case the record would have stereophonic     properties.

The source and drain are thus connected by a so-called inversion layer, in which the majority charge carrier (electrons) is the minority one in the bulk of the semiconductor (which is p-type, so holes are the majority carrier). Using a voltage to control the number of mobile electrons in this layer, or induced surface channel as it is sometimes called, is the basis of the device's operation. Interest in the scientific potential of the inversion layer was awakened in the late 1950s. Theoretical considerations indicated that if the electric field applied to the surface could be made strong enough to confine the mobile electrons to a very thin layer near the semiconductor's surface, with thickness comparable to the wavelength associated with the electrons there, then the electrons'  <head>motion</head>  perpendicular to the surface would be quantised.

The Davy lamp was the direct result of the mine owners' concern to recover coal, not from deeper shafts but from existing workings that were inaccessible because of a process known as creep. When the veins of coal were mined, pillars of coal had to be left to hold up the roof of the mine, rather like the pillars in a multistorey car park. The weight of the roof pushed the pillars down and the resulting pressure also forced the floor to buckle and move upwards. The downward  <head>motion</head>  of the pillars and the upward motion of the floor gradually combined to shut off the passageways and close the mine.

Temperatures in such systems reached about 10 electron volts (eV), about 100 000 K. Experiments had shown that the current-carrying ring of hot gas in a simple toroidal pinch was unstable, so that the hot gas (plasma) struck the walls and was cooled far too rapidly. Theoretical research in the United States confirmed that these instabilities were a natural characteristic of the system. This result was interpreted as having some favourable aspects. In particular, the resulting  <head>motion</head>  of the plasma column in the magnetic field  motion that eventually destroyed the containment  might heat the ions in the plasma; also, image currents in  metallic  conducting walls of the torus might limit the  excusions  of the plasma column.

It is tempting to assume that the same rule applies, but quasar redshifts are, in some cases, very much bigger than any measured galaxy redshift, so the assumption involves considerable extrapolation. It is this assumption, however, which is the basis of claims that the most distant quasars known are upwards of 10000 million light years away from us, receding at more than 90 per cent of the speed of light. A few astronomers have raised doubts about this extrapolation from ordinary galaxies to all extragalactic objects. They argue that redshifts can be produced in other ways than through the expansion of the Universe by gravity; by the rapid  <head>motion</head>  of an object, a true Doppler shift that, thanks to relativistic effects, produces a redshift even if the object is moving across the line of sight; or by other, unknown, means.

The delegation of authority, as Lugard's admiring but scrupulous biographer, Margery Perham, admits, was quite foreign to his nature. So obsessed was he with the details of administration that he saw nothing inappropriate, while Governor-General of Nigeria, in personally composing a memorandum on the issue of chamber pots to second-class administrative officers: he was, he said, against it. He never developed a proper Secretariat for the Nigerian government and confided in no one but his devoted brother, whom he appointed his Political Secretary. He was a passionate tourer, always in  <head>motion</head> , descending on his Residents with floods of instructions which resumed their unceasing flow as soon as he returned to headquarters; and long before Northern Nigeria was brought under effective British occupation, he was composing his Political Memoranda , which in addition to his reflections on the subject of Indirect Rule contained instructions to his officers of a comprehensiveness simply beyond satire.

In fact, the planets possessed barely one per cent of the solar system's mass, but had somehow acquired 98 per cent of its angular momentum. The sun, in brief, spins some 100 times slower than it should do if the  equation is correct.

Sam had been using tape echo, or slap-back, and whether he was doing it on purpose or not, he also treated Elvis's voice like another instrument. The voice was real close to the rest of the music and most times back then, in country and pop, the vocal was always way out in front; even on RCA the voice was out more than we were used to. But in Heartbreak Hotel , which has a real deep echo, they had a speaker set up at one end of this long hallway and a microphone at the other end, and a sign on the door saying DON'T OPEN THE DOOR WHEN THE RED LIGHT IS ON. Room echo back then was virtually unheard of in recording, although they used it in  <head>motion</head>  pictures for sound effects.

Irrespective of the style of the piece, all music creates tension and release (dissonance and consonance) which brings on different emotions in its audience. In most pop music for instance, the verse sections of a song often end with a Dominant chord (ex D7, D11 etc.) which creates tension. This tension is then satisfyingly released by the resolution from the Dominant chord to the tonic chord which usually starts off the chorus of the song. Solos also create tension and release, depending on the soloist's ability to create  <head>motion</head>  over the chord changes via his/her improvising.

He died while driving a Warrior armoured fighting vehicle escorting a civilian ambulance.

Roy Smith, councillor for Golf Green, Clacton, will be urging Tendring District Council to support his  <head>motion</head>  and express its opposition to Government plans to raise prices. In the last Budget, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced the Government's decision to extend VAT to domestic gas and electricity at 8 per cent next year and at 17.5pc by 1995. Mr Smith's motion, which he will put before the council as soon as possible, says this will increase the weekly bills of all households, but will particularly affect pensioners and others on low incomes. The extra financial burden placed on those least able to afford such rises will inevitably impact on the services provided by this local authority, he said. Mr Smith hopes that his campaign will attract the support of all organisations for the elderly or those on low incomes. His motion is backed by Lionel Randall, last year's chairman of the council.

The church figured in this document only in the same general terms as it figured in Magna Carta; there was one reference to prohibitions, but begging still the question of what were temporalities and what were not. This in itself bears witness to the limits of clerical influence. Although Winchelsey was a leading figure in political opposition to the crown in 1297 and in 131011, his influence on the two occasions differed, for whereas in 1297 both clergy and laity shared a common grievance over taxation, this was not so in 131011.

The script for The Chase, also by Terry Nation, called for Episode One to end with a Dalek rising dramatically out of the sand to menace the time-travellers. On this occasion the Director, against Cusick's advice, decided to do the shot by actually burying a full-size Dalek in a sand pit, the idea being to use a tow rope, attached to a Land Rover, to pull the machine from its sandy grave. The filming crew spent a full morning digging a suitably sized pit with a sloping ramp, filling it in again once the Dalek had been rolled into place. Only when the cameras were rolling was it heart-sinkingly apparent that the physics of inertia, represented by nearly a ton of resting sand, were greater than the physics of  <head>motion</head>  represented by the four skidding wheels of a Land Rover. In order to use any selected function Enter key must be pressed and the function will operate as long as the stylus is depressedreleasing it cancels the function. The single most difficult thing I found when using the Grafpad was to remember whether I was drawing on the screen or mapping the attributes. The current screen mode is displayed in the centre of the information bar so it should be simple to keep track of what's going on but dropping into Attribute mode and spraying colour across pixel boundaries can be very frustrating. The accuracy of the tablet is matched to the Spectrum, the grid inside the tablet's surface consists of a wire mesh 176 by 256, so the movement of the stylus on the screen corresponds exactly to its motion on the surface of the Grafpad.

At this stage in the fire's development, sideways spread is not a problem and can easily be constrained by a good protective system.

For example, if a manager is employee-centred, if he delegates and is participative, then he will have a happy working environment but he will not produce a high performance unless he also establishes standards of performance. A manager's concern for people must be matched by his concern for achieving results. This linking of the human relations approach with scientific management targets will provide the recipe for effective performance. It is important to remember that management techniques such as time and  <head>motion</head>  study, financial controls etc are used by high producing managers at least as completely as by the low producing managers, but in quite different ways.

The bacteria have, embedded in their cell membranes, receptor molecules  that is, proteins whose molecular architecture enables them to recognize the glucose molecules  and tiny whip-like projections (flagella) which, by beating in unison, can row the bacteria up the glucose gradient. Mutants which lack the glucose receptors fail to show such behaviour, even though they will continue to make use of the glucose as an energy source if placed directly in contact with it. More complex single-celled animals, such as paramoecium, have similar projections, called cilia, connected at their bases by a system of fine threads, which enable the beat of the cilia to be coordinated. Except when it is actually feeding (it eats bacteria), the paramoecium is in constant  <head>motion</head> , frequently bumping into obstacles in its path and, when it does so, reversing by switching the beat of the cilia on one side.

1. There is a debate about discrepancies between the writings of Marx as a young man and his later output.

Andrea used her skills to create a performance piece, Trapeze, in which randomly edited and visually degraded news footage is projected over her suspended body. Entirely encased in a latex bodysuit she becomes anonymous, even androgynous. Hanging limp as a corpse, or straining to hold complex, delicately balanced poses, the elation of her soaring figure is juxtaposed with the very real pain and physical distress incurred. The contorted postures provide an eloquent visual commentary to the simultaneously projected real life imagery; her video and installation work include fragile, barely existing images (negative or miniature projections) of swinging figures, or herself freefalling from a 200 foot crane, continually repeated, as if caught in a time-loop of seemingly endless  <head>motion</head> .

For most of the time he combined this with the very important post of deputy treasurer-at-wars.

Ronald M Birse , Matthew  (17531781), engineer and inventor, was born at 3 Narrow Wine Street, Bristol, where he was baptized 18 November 1753, the son of Mary and William Wasbrough, originally a barber-surgeon and peruke maker, who was in partnership with Roger Rice in a brass-founding and clock-making business in Narrow Wine Street. He had at least three older brothers. Taking an early interest in his father's work, he constructed a steam engine with which to drive all the lathes and other machines; in order to do this, he had to convert the reciprocating movement of the Newcomen-type beam engine into rotary  <head>motion</head> . He achieved this by using a ratchet-and-pawl mechanism to produce the rotary motion, combined with a flywheel which reduced the otherwise excessive variations in the speed of rotation. On 10 March 1779 Wasbrough was granted a patent (no. 1,213) for a machine, which when applied to a steam-engine or any perpendicular motion will cause such movement to become circular, without the medium of a water-wheel, for grinding wheat and other grain, and for grinding, rolling, hammering, and other uses in mechanical operations. The ratchet-and-pawl device was quite effective in principle, but not robust or reliable enough in constant use, and it seems that, after he completed an engine to drive a mill owned by James Pickard at Snow Hill in Birmingham, it was found to be unsatisfactory, and a crank was substituted. It is not known who suggested this alteration, but anyhow the problem was solved; in the words of John Farey q.v.: The engine then answered so much better than anything which had been tried before that the same principle has been followed ever since. This was probably the first successful application of the crank to a steam engine in order to produce rotary motion. A patent (no. 1,263) was granted to Pickard on 23 August 1780 for a new-invented method of applying steam engines to the turning of wheeles, whereby a rotative motion is performed, and the power of the engine is more immediately and fully applied than by the intervention of water.

Alford made his name as a vigorous and informed opponent of impositions, monopolies, proclamations, and purveyance, and was an inveterate foe of Chancery. Already in 1610 he was one of a select number of the Lower House who met with the lord treasurer, Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury q.v., son of his father's patron, to discuss impositions. He was always reluctant to approve subsidies; in 1621, when other members were prepared to pledge their lives and fortunes to recover the Palatinate, he observed bitterly that the farmers would say, if you will have three taxes in one year, we must have three harvests in one year. Such rhetoric was backed by a proper concern for the freedom and order of the House, down to such details as a successful  <head>motion</head>  (16 December 1606) that the adjournment of a committee on a bill should be announced in the House.

Maximum ozone concentration occurs at a height of 1618 km in polar latitudes and at about 25 km over the equator. This ozone layer is important to society and the environment for two reasons. Firstly, the ozone absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation in the UV-B or 280320 nm wavelengths, thus warming the stratosphere and producing a steep temperature inversion between 15 and 50 km. As temperature decreases with height in the troposphere (reaching -40 to -80 C at the tropopause), the effect of a warm stratosphere is to act as a ceiling or lid to vertical  <head>motion</head>  in the troposphere  that is, convective processes which produce clouds and precipitation are contained within the troposphere.
